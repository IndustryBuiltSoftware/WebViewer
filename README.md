# WebViewer
A simple web viewer part that can be added to a page or role center to allow inline viewing of secure web URLs. The general idea is that you add the web viewer part to a role center and from there, a user can access one or more URLs directly from their role center.

As this uses the standard Dynamics NAV 2017 web viewer component, only HTTPS urls are supported.

This example includes the Business Manager role center that as already been modified to include the web viewer part.
